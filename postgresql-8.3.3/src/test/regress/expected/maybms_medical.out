/* A medical example representing for assigning diagnosis based on symptoms.

   Given is a database listing diseases and their accompanying symptoms. For
   each disease the database contains possible treatments that can be
   administered by a physician.
   Each treatment can be effective up to a certain degree, if no improvement is
   observed in the patient, this can indicate either an incorrect diagnosis,
   or that the treatment has no effect on the patient for other reasons.

   Assume a patient complains from a set of symptoms. Based on initial
   observations of the symptoms, select the most probable diagnosis and start
   treatment for it. Then, reconsider the diagnosis based on the outcomes of
   the treatment.
