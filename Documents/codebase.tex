\label{sect:codebase}

MayBMS is currently implemented in PostgreSQL 8.3.3. Integration into
an existing full-fledged DBMS brings two major advantages. First,
integration makes it possible to reuse the internal functions and
structures of the DBMS. Secondly, it often increases the efficiency of
query processing.

Figures~\ref{fig:modified-files1} and \ref{fig:modified-files2} give a
list of source files modified or added to the original PostgreSQL
8.3.3. All modifications are explicitly marked in the source files by 
\begin{verbatim}
/* MAYBMS BEGIN */
... [some code goes here]
/* MAYBMS END */
\end{verbatim}
All files in directory \texttt{maybms} are newly created and the
others are existing files in PostgreSQL8.3.3. Header files (*.h) refer
to \texttt{src/include/directory/filename}. Source files (*.c and *.y)
refer to \texttt{src/backend/directory/filename}.
