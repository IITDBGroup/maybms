		<h2>What is MayBMS?</h2>
		<!--l. 82--><p>The <span 
		class="cmti-12">MayBMS </span>system (note: MayBMS is read as &#8220;maybe-MS&#8221;, like DBMS) is a
		complete probabilistic database management system that leverages robust
		relational database technology: MayBMS is an extension of the Postgres server
		backend. MayBMS is open source and the source code is available under the BSD
		license.
		</p>
		<p>   MayBMS stands alone as a complete probabilistic database management
		system that supports a powerful, compositional query language for which
		nevertheless worst-case efficiency and result quality guarantees can be made.
		The MayBMS backend is accessible through
		several APIs, with efficient internal operators for computing and managing
		probabilistic data.
		</p>
		<p>In summary, MayBMS has the following features:</p>	
		<ul>
		<li>Full support of all features of PostgreSQL 8.3.3, including unrestricted
		query functionality, query optimization, APIs, updates, concurrency
		control and recovery, etc.
		</li>
		<li>Essentially  no  performance  loss  on  PostgreSQL  8.3.3  functionality:
		After parsing a query or DML statement, a fast syntactic check is made
		to decide whether the statement uses the extended functionality of
		MayBMS. If it does not, the subsequently executed code is exactly that
		of PostgreSQL 8.3.3.
		</li>
		<li>Support for efficiently creating and updating probabilistic databases,
		i.e., uncertain databases in which degrees of belief can be associated
		with uncertain data.
		</li>
		<li>A powerful query and update language for processing uncertain data
		that  gracefully  extends  SQL  with  a  small  number  of  well-designed
		language constructs.
		</li>
		<li>State-of-the-art   efficient   techniques   for   exact   and   approximate
		probabilistic inference.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="node sticky"> 
		<h2>Applications</h2>
		<p>Database systems for uncertain and probabilistic data promise to have many
		applications. Query processing on uncertain data occurs in the contexts of data
		warehousing, data integration, and of processing data extracted from
		the Web. Data cleaning can be fruitfully approached as a problem of
		reducing uncertainty in data and requires the management and processing of
		large amounts of uncertain data. Decision support and diagnosis systems                                                                      
		employ hypothetical (what-if) queries. Scientific databases, which store
		outcomes of scientific experiments, frequently contain uncertain data such as
		incomplete observations or imprecise measurements. Sensor and RFID data is
		inherently uncertain. Applications in the contexts of fighting crime or
		terrorism, tracking moving objects, surveillance, and plagiarism detection
		essentially rely on techniques for processing and managing large uncertain
		datasets. Beyond that, many further potential applications of probabilistic
		databases exist and will manifest themselves once such systems become
		available.
		</p>
		<p>   The MayBMS distribution comes with a number of examples that illustrate its
		use in these application domains. Some of these examples are described in the
		tutorial chapter of our <a href="http://maybms.sourceforge.net/manual/index.html">manual</a>.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
MayBMS is a state-of-the-art probabilistic database management system
developed as an extension of the Postgres server backend.
</p>

<p>The MayBMS project is founded on the thesis that a principled effort to use
and extend mature relational database technology
will be essential for creating
robust and scalable systems for managing and querying large uncertain
datasets.
</p>
<p>
MayBMS stands alone as a complete probabilistic database management system
that supports a very powerful, compositional query language
(<a href="http://maybms.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/maybms/maybms/examples/">examples</a>) for which
nevertheless worst-case efficiency and result quality guarantees can be made.
Central to this is our choice of essentially using probabilistic versions of
conditional tables as the representation system, but in a form engineered
for admitting the efficient evaluation and automatic optimization
of most operations of our language using robust and mature relational
database technology.
</p>

<p>
Central themes in our research include the creation of foundations of query
languages for probabilistic databases by developing analogs of relational
algebra and SQL and the development of efficient query processing techniques.
In practice, the efficient evaluation of queries on probabilistic data
requires approximation techniques, and another important goal is to
understand which approximation guarantees can be made for complex,realistic query languages.
Apart from data representation and storage
mechanisms, a query language, and query processing techniques, our work
covers query optimization, an update language, concurrency control and
recovery, and APIs for uncertain data.

<h2>Papers on the MayBMS1 Prototype</h2>


<p>
Note: We are currently working on the second prototype of MayBMS -- MayBMS2 --
which is based on <a href="download/maybms2-talk.pdf">U-relations</a>
as the representation system (see our ICDE 2008 paper).
The first prototype, MayBMS1, was based on
<a href="download/maybms1-talk.pdf">world-set decompositions (WSDs)</a>.
U-relations allow for more efficient query processing than WSDs and are
more succinct.
